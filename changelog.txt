Version: 1.1.3

* Refactored code as a first step towards fixing equipment detection incompatibilities with RBM, with no immediate effect on users.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an issue where heroes were naked on the campaign map after siege battles.
* Resolved an issue of arena spectators appearing without clothing.
